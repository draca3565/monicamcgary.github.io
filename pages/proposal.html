<h1> Purpose</h1>
    <p> For my project, I want to create a site that has dragon craft projects. There will be different pages for different levels of difficulty. One page will be for kid crafts, there will be about five project ideas. The page will show an image of the completed project, short description, and a link that takes the user to the full instruction website. The full instruction will be someone else’s webpage. This project will be good for people who like dragons and want to find a website that has good ideas without having to search the entire web. The projects are other people’s so the link will take the user to their websites. </p>
<p></p>
<h2>Audience</h2>
    <p>The audience is more targeted to people who love dragons. More specifically for stay at home-mothers that need ideas to keep their children happy. The age group will be diverse most likely in the range of 16-35. It can be male or female, but I presume that it will be mostly female. Many kids like to play pretend, what better way than with a dragon that they have created. They could play knights and dragons. I know that I love dragons, but struggle to find good projects that are fun and challenging. There are many dragon lovers out there, and many would love to be able to make their own dragon, but do not know how. Children will be using their imaginations; studies have shown that children that use their imaginations do better in school. </p>
