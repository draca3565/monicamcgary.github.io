                <p>Sam Caldes said that the sketches look good, but that I may need to add some white spaces to the top and around some of the content.</p>
                <p> Shaelyn Rich said the sketches look good, but like Sam said I might need to add some white spaces</p>
                <p> As I do my site I will make sure to have some white spaces like they suggested.</p>
