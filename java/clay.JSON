"Clay": {
    "Tools and materials":"Measuring cups, 1 cup plain flour, 1/2 cup Elmer's glue or wood glue, 1/4 cup cornstarch or corn flour, Moisturizer (hand/body lotion) - we use Vaseline, 1 tsp olive oil (or cooking oil), 1/2 tsp vinegar",
"Instructions":
"If you can add more vinegar if you feel that the clay is still hard after kneading but not too much please. Alright, firstly pour all the above ingredients to a plastic container. We don't recommend bowl or things from your kitchen where you use it for foods because we use glue here. Even though the glue is non-toxic, we just don't feel good about it. Honestly, we prefer to use baking paper. Just place it on top of kitchen bench and pour all ingredients onto it. Next step is mixing and kneading. Knead well until clay soft and stretchy. That's all basically. For storing, use cling wrap and put it in sealed plastic bag.",
